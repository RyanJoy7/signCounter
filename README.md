# Number Sign Counter

## About

**Number Sign Counter** is a simple program written in **x86 Assembly (Intel syntax)**.  
It was created as a learning project while I was exploring low-level programming and understanding how to handle user input, conditionals, and basic logic in assembly.

The program prompts the user to enter a number of values and then reports how many of them are:
- Positive
- Negative
- Zero
